# Myocardial Infarction Compilation
The Myocardial infarction Compilation dataset is a dataset collected at the Krasnoyarsk Interdistrict Clinical Hospital (I. S. Berzon (Russia)) in 1992-1995. This dataset consists of 1700 data with 124 attributes. Attribute 2 to attribute 112 act as input data for making predictions. This collection of attributes itself consists of categorical and non-categorical attributes. While attributes 113 to 123 are categorical attributes, this collection of attributes aims to define the compilation experienced by the patient, such as atrial fibrillation (heart arrhythmia disorder), supraventricular tachycardia (heart rhythm disorder), ventricular tachycardia (very fast heartbeat) and other disorders .
